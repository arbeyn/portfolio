          My journey into software engineering started when I was about 14 and
          built my first website using basic HTML and CSS. The process of
          writing lines of code and seeing something tangible appear on the
          screen fascinated me. It wasn’t perfect, of course, but it sparked a
          passion that hasn’t stopped growing since. Fast forward a few years,
          and now I’m deeply immersed in the world of algorithms, data
          structures, and software design patterns, learning how to write
          efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.
